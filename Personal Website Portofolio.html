        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a young gap year "student" whos developing his skills in programming, to land a job/apprenticeship 
            to evolve my experience in the working world and tackle real life problems. I am eager to work in a team
            aswell as working by myself in my own space and time to solve bugs and issues in any upcoming projects.
            I am passionate about starting my career and driving improvements in performance, including increasing key 
            metrics and percentages. 
        </p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h2>
          
            <p>I started playing football at the age of 6, and over the years, my passion and dedication to the sport helped me 
            develop my skills significantly. By the time I reached the U18 level, I was able to contribute to the team’s 
            remarkable results, consistently improving my performance on the field. Through football, I not only honed my technical 
            skills but also built essential qualities like teamwork, hard work, and effective communication. Working closely with 
            teammates, learning to strategize, and pushing through challenges taught me the value of collaboration and perseverance, skills that I 
            carry with me in every aspect of life.
            </p>
       
            <p>Going to the gym has been a key factor in helping me build discipline and maintain a consistent routine. By committing to a regular gym 
            schedule, I developed the self-control to stay dedicated to my fitness goals, even on days when motivation was low. This discipline extended 
            beyond physical training and has positively impacted my overall health, improving my strength, endurance, and energy levels. The consistency in 
            my workouts has not only helped me stay in better shape but has also taught me the importance of setting goals and working steadily toward 
            achieving them, a mindset I apply to all areas of my life.
            </p>
